		<em><strong>THE PLACE I  COME FROM!!!</strong></em> 
	</p>
	<p class="Qoute"> My name is <strong>Ayu Samuel Ayu,</strong> From the hills of <strong><em>Obanliku,</em></strong> Cross River State - Nigeria. I hail from one of the politically and economically less developed LGAs as far as Cross River as a whole is concerned. Access to good infrastructures from my ends are practically difficult to reach. Infrastructures in this context, covers a wide range of; Motorable roads, standard health care facilities, good schools with superstitious laboratories, industries and factories to curtail unemployment among the vibrant graduate class of youths. Despite our richness in economic and natural resources, we have suffered neglect from the government over the years. Obanliku in it 31st year of existence has obviously remained the same way it was since inception, no major changes of development even in this present day where we have prominent men at the spheres of government, we still suffer from under-development.</p>

	<p>Growing up as a child in the safe streets of Sankwala was really cool and filled with fun, as a child I had high hopes that before my transition from childhood - adolescent and from adolescent - my early adulthood, there will be major changes to the trenches I grew up in. But unfortunately, the state of the LG is increasingly deplecting and nothing is really done about it. <em>So sad...</em></p>

 	<p>It's so sad how the people that were elected to represent the interest of Obanliku right from grassroot level to the highest level in the state and the federal sphere have turned out to secure their personal interest first with no rethink the of general interest of Obanliku. 2023 is by the corner, they will come again with their empty promises, but the youth forces are now wiser. We will vote only the right candidate irrespective of political party.</p>
